The idea here is to uset the fact that verify run very slow,more then 10 seconds for sure so we can first 
send to verify a good signuatre for 'echo cool' taken from the example.json,so this part will pass with success.

at the time verify is cheking the good signuatre,I run another thread that overwrite the data this time to run our command -> echo hacked,
so that when run.py gets to execute_script it againg opening the file for reading and read our command.

so,this integration between the secure part of verify which works a lot of time and, and execution part that again open the file(so we can change it meanwhile) will make this problem happen. 

the usage is run : python q5.py
